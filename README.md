# SFUMATO

Sfumato is a lean, modern, utility-based CSS framework with relative UI scaling built-in.
Create one simple "sfumato.json" file for your web-based app or website project and run the Sfumato CLI command.
It will watch you as you work, keep track of your markup changes, and generate a custom, tiny CSS library based on only what you use in your project.
Sfumato has Dart Sass built-in (cross platform) so you gain all the benefits of SCSS logic and features as part of your stylesheet development!

Install dotnet 7 or later from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and then install Sfumato with the following command:

```dotnet tool install --global argentini.sfumato```
