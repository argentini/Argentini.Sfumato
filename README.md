# SFUMATO

Sfumato is a lean, modern, utility-based CSS framework generation tool. It is compatible with the Tailwind CSS class naming structure and has the following additional features:

- The Sfumato CLI tool is written in cross-platform (multi-threaded) native code, not javascript, and is much faster than Tailwind
- Dart Sass (also cross-platform native code) is embedded so you get all the benefits of using Sass as part of your workflow
- Sfumato provides an optional scalable CSS system that makes all the viewport sizes between breakpoints scale like a PDF for a more controlled layout
- Theme mode that supports system theme matching, as well as classes that include an "auto" class to fall back to system matching
- Integrated form element styles (class compatible with Tailwind forms plugin)
- One install works for all your projects!

## How To Use

Create one simple "sfumato.yml" file (manually or using the Sfumato "init" command) for your web-based app or website project and run the Sfumato CLI "watch" command. It will watch your project files as you work, keeping track of your markup changes, and will transpile your SCSS files into custom, tiny CSS files based only on the Sfumato features you use.

Use the following command for more information on Sfumato commands and options:
