            2) HOW DOES FINCH RATE PRODUCTS?
          </h3>
          <p class="pb-[3rem] text-md">
            We aggregate scientific sources, manually research company practices
            and product profiles, empower people to help test and score products
            in their daily lives, and then use machine learning to capture all
            that data in our ratings. We look at the full life cycle of every
            product we rate and combine function and scientific fact to find the
            best of the best.

            5) WHY THE NAME ‘FINCH’?
          </h3>
          <p class="pb-[3rem] text-md">
            Finches are one of the most adaptable, resilient creatures on the
            planet. Gregarious and bright, their simple song unites flocks of
            hundreds, called charms (how charming!). They are a symbol of joy,
            energy, and brighter times ahead. They love the wild, but also
            flourish in urban areas, and of course, eat local. This prolific
            little bird famously studied by Darwin has shown us how we can make
            small changes to adapt and thrive in an unpredictable world. We also
            can’t say ‘finch’ without thinking of Atticus Finch, a fictional
            character synonymous with integrity, accountability, and a better
            life for all.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-display text-sm uppercase tracking-wider pb-[1rem]">
            6) DO YOU TAKE COMMISSION FOR REVIEWS?
          </h3>
          <p class="pb-[3rem] text-md">
            Nope! To maintain our unbiased rating system, we do not accept
            payment from companies for reviews or product placement.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-display text-sm uppercase tracking-wider pb-[1rem]">
            7) WHAT’S THE CHARM?
          </h3>
          <p class="pb-[3rem] text-md">
            The Charm is Finch’s ambassador program, through which vetted
            individuals and families are deemed ‘Finch Finders’ that provide
            candid feedback about how well products work, how long they last,
            and how enjoyable they are to use. Finders’ real reviews are a
            component of the “Using It” score within all Finch ratings. There
            are thousands of products out there, and our Charm of Finders help
            to test everything for functionality and quality – combining their
            real reviews with the real science is how we find the best of the
            best.

            8) HOW DOES FINCH MAKE MONEY?
          </h3>
          <p class="pb-[3rem] text-md">
            Our first priority is to maintain the integrity of our data and
            insights. Companies neither pay us to be included in our tools, nor
            to get better scores. We always do the digging and testing first,
            but sometimes brands like what they see and offer us an affiliate
            fee to link out to their page in our Wise Guides. We’re still a
            young company and, when we scale, our main source of revenue will
            come from working with companies to help them focus on what matters
            and provide anonymized, aggregate intel on what we’ve learned from
            the Charm. We will never share individuals’ information, purchasing
            history, or browsing habits.
