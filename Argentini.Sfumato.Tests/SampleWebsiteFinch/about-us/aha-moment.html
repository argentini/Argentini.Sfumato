            A note from our founder
          </p>
          <p class="text-p pb-[1rem]">
            For nearly twenty years, I’ve devoted my life to the fight against
            climate change. All the while, friends and family have peppered me
            with questions about the sustainability of consumer goods: What
            sheets should my sister-in-law buy for her new baby’s crib? Do paper
            towels lead to deforestation? What’s a paraben?
          </p>
          <p class="text-p pb-[1rem]">
            Cutting through the jargon and searching for answers requires time
            and energy. Diving deep on this stuff is one of my favorite hobbies,
            but even with advanced degrees and years of corporate sustainability
            experience, it made me wonder why sustainability is so daunting,
            complicated and exhausting.
          </p>
          <p class="text-p pb-[1rem]">
            And what about people that don’t have someone like me on their speed
            dial? So, in 2017, I started a blog to share my research and help
            people make more sustainable choices. More and more questions
            flooded in, and people I didn’t know started following along. That’s
            when it hit me: Most of us want to do better, but we aren’t sure
            where to start. This isn’t about believing in climate change, it’s
            about understanding it. This is what led to Finch…
          </p>
          <p class="text-p pb-[1rem]">
            At Finch, our goal is to equip people with the x-ray vision to see
            through the bullsh*t and the know-how to choose wisely.
          </p>
          <p class="text-p pb-[1rem]">
            At the end of the day, consumerism in any form won’t solve the
            problem, but I firmly believe that we all have a role to play.
            Understanding the science of sustainability gives control back to
            people as citizens, not just as consumers.
