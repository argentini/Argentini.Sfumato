# Sfumato: The Ultra-Fast CSS Generation Tool
            
Sfumato is a lean, modern, utility-based CSS framework with relative UI scaling and adaptive design built-in. Add few lines to your CSS file and Sfumato will watch your project as you work, keeping track of changes, and generate a custom, tiny CSS file based only on the utility classes you use. And Sfumato uses the same class naming convention as Tailwind CSS v4!

Install dotnet 9 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download and then install Sfumato with the following command:

```dotnet tool install --global argentini.sfumato```
